# rafflers
A collection of fun, funky, estoric rafflers

## How does it work?
It's easy! Just create a directory in the top level for your raffler.

Each raffler should accept a line-delimited file of names and echo a single random name out of the list at random. See the example_names file for, well, an example!

You can write it in any language (provided you can prove to our hosts that it's not malware). If you've got dependencies, please include a simple install.sh for the debian dependencies.
